# Artificial-Immune-Microbiome
 An artificial immune system algorithm focused on classifying microbiome data. 
 
 This repository includes code and data for a CU Boulder CSCI 5423: Bio-inspired Multi-agent Systems final project. The goal of this project was to use a variation of the clonal selection AIS algorithm to classify saliva vs sebum samples from the Human Microbiome Project.
